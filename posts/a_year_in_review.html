        <p>The year 2021 has finally passed. In Melbourne, we've spent 109 days in lockdown.</p>
        <p>Working from home is great! I save money and time that would have been spent on commuting to work using public transport. I get to cook my own lunch and get out of bed late.</p>
        <p>But I do miss the interactions with my fellow co-workers. Even for someone like me who prefers to go out only once or twice a week with friends. Before I never felt lonely and cooped up, but for the first time, I did in 2021.</p>
        <p>As the number of COVID cases rises in Melbourne, I erred on the side of caution. Choosing to interact online on Discord and avoid going to crowded areas and the city. I feel a lingering sense of concern for my parents.</p>
        <p>I hope next year should be better.</p>
