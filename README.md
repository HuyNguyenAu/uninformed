# Uninformed
A small and simple website that contains a collection of things that interest me.

## Why?
I wanted a simple and hassle-free way to host a collection of notes about
my thoughts and observations.

The technical goal of this project was to use a small CSS framework and construct a simple and clean website layout whilst keeping the design and complexity to a minimum.


## Why not use a Static Site Generator or blogging platform?
Hosting on Github is very convenient and I like to go back to the basic form of HTML and CSS.
